# Stock Price Prediction App with LSTM

This is a Machine Learning web app built using Keras, Streamlit, and Yahoo Finance API to predict stock prices using historical closing data.

## Features

- Real-time stock ticker input (e.g., GOOG, AAPL)
- Visualize stock trends using moving averages (MA100, MA200)
- Predict future prices using a deep LSTM model
- Compare predicted vs actual prices with plots
- Interactive web UI built using Streamlit

## Project Overview

This project trains an LSTM neural network on stock price data from Yahoo Finance between 2015â€“2025. The model uses the previous 100 days of closing prices to predict future prices.

## Sample Output
